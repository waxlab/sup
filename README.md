Super Unambiguous Unobstrusive Understandable Plain Text Format
===============================================================

This project contains the specification of the Sup file format developed for
simple or complex documents writing using only plain text.

It is mainly inspired by Markdown simplicity, reStructuredText extendability,
LaTeX power and traditional printing books.

To know how it works, just open and read its specification under
in the spec.sup file.
